## AirText

# Creating Text Out of Thin Air

The goal of AirText is to infer the texts written by the fingertip in the air, using only the [inertial measurement unit (IMU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_measurement_unit) readings, for example the accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometer, from the smartPhone as input.

Users can shake their phone to indicate a backspace.
